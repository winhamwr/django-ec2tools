Django ec2tools is a set of management commands designed to help running Django on an Amazon EC2 instance using EBS and all of that good stuff. Right now, that pretty much just consists of a management command and django_extensions jobs for taking snapshots of your EBS volumes for backup purposes.

Also, thanks to Django-filter for letting me rip off all of their project cruft stuff :)
